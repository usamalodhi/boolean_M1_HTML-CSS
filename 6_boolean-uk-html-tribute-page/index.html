              The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: torre pendente di Pisa), or
              simply the Tower of Pisa , is the campanile, or freestanding bell
              tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known
              worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an
              unstable foundation. The tower is situated behind the Pisa
              Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's
              Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the
              Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183 feet
              3 inches) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 m (185 ft 11
              in) on the high side.

              The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0 in). Its
              weight is estimated at 14,500 tonnes (16,000 short tons).[2] The
              tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps
              on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during
              construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could
              not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened
              through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By
              1990, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.The structure was
              stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced
              the tilt to 3.97 degrees

This will put into practice everything we have learned so far about HTML & CSS. The below image shows level of detail you should replicate from Twitter:

## Setup

1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. Open a Pull Request back to the upstream repo

## Instructions

- Use the HTML elements you've learned about so far to define the page content
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style the page
- Use CSS Grid for the layout and components
- You should start _without_ images and then add them later at the end of the exercise once the basic criteria has been met

### Tips

- Breakdown the page into sections
- Pay attention to alignment and spacing
- Work section by section until it looks good

## Assesment Criteria

- &#9745; Layout the main page elements (left-hand menu, tweet feed and right side-bar) using CSS Grid. CSS Grid should also be used to layout individual tweets.
- &#9745; Define the page contents using HTML with appropriate elements. HTML should be well formatted.
- &#9745; Style the page using a mixture of Type, ID and Class CSS selector types
- &#9745; Implement hover and selected state for the left-hand menu links.

### Extension Criteria

- &#9745; Make the layout responsive so that the side-bars are removed on lower resolution devices
- &#9745; Include images using the `img` and `svg` tags.

  - Get the source for the icon images from the Twitter website as SVG and include them with `svg` tags
  - Use a local file for the profile image. Research how to use CSS to to make the profile image appear as a circle

  CSS Navigation - use the following Comment titles to Navigate to a particular section in styles.css
